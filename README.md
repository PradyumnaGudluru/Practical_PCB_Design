## Description
This is a portfolio page for the coursework in the coursework of ECEN_5730 at CU Boulder under the Instructor Professor Eric Bogatin.
This course consists of lab assignments and design of boards.
The details of Boards and Assignments are as follows.

## Boards
There are four boards designed in the course of the semester.

1. Board 1 - Design of a 555-timer circuit:
The purpose of this lab is to design a 555-timer circuit, measure different characteristics of timer output, with and without load, etc.

2. Board 2 - Design of Board with Hex inverter with Good and Bad Layout:
The purpose of this board is for you to show off how layout decisions influence the amount of switching noise and the best measurement practices for measuring switching noise in a PCB.

3. Board 3 - Design of a Golden Arduino Board:
The purpose of this board is to understand the design flow, test and evaluate different features on the golden Arduino board.

4. Board 4 - Design of a Instrument Droid:
The purpose of this board is to design and build a 4-layer board with many different components and finally perform a special function of estimating the resistance of input sources with some code written on Arduino.

## Lab Assignments
There are eight Lab assignments in the course of this semester.

1. Lab 5 - Slammer Circuit:
The purpose of the lab is to build a slammer circuit which will draw a fast transient current from the power rail.

2. Lab 9 - Cross Talk:
This lab experiment is to analyze the cross talk between the signal return loops in a test board given by the professor.

3. Lab 11_12 - Measure Trace Resistance and Blow-up traces:
This lab experiment is to learn basic measurement practices of traces using 2-wire and 4-wire methods. To understand the maximum current that can be passed through the narrow traces, the traces are set to blow up.

4. Lab 15 - Good-Bad switching noise board:
This lab is to measure some of the switching properties of a version of your board 2.

5. Lab 16 - Diff or SE signaling and ground noise:
To compare the quality of the analog signal measurements from a sensor using a single-ended and differential pair measurement and explore signals on the I2C bus.
![Lab 16](https://github.com/PradyumnaGudluru/Practical_PCB_Design/tree/main/Lab_Assignments/Lab_16)

6. Lab 18 - Measure the in rush current and operation current of a board:
To measure the in rush current and steady state current draw that a board draws from the power supply.
![Lab 18](https://github.com/PradyumnaGudluru/Practical_PCB_Design/tree/main/Lab_Assignments/Lab_18)

7. Lab 21 - SBB version of Brd 4:
To build a solderless breadboard version of board 4 to demonstrate the basic operation and simple code to perform the measurements. An instrument droid is designed and VRM by measuring Thevenin voltage and Thevenin resistance.
![Lab 21](https://github.com/PradyumnaGudluru/Practical_PCB_Design/tree/main/Lab_Assignments/Lab_21)

8. Lab 25 - SBB circuits: Ferrites:
To understand reduction of noise on a power line using a ferrite filter or a LC filter, using a ferrite filter test board provided by professor.
